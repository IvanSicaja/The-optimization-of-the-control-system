📚🔍 **Project description:** ⬇︎⬇︎⬇︎

💡 **App Purpose**  
The goal of this project was to replace a basic **ON-OFF regulator** for a **DC motor control system** with a more advanced **PID regulator**. The task involved designing a controller to keep a mounted horizontal plate balanced despite system rotations, ensuring higher precision, stability, and robustness compared to the ON-OFF regulator.

🧠 **How It Works**

- System setup: A **DC motor** with two shafts, one connected to a **horizontal plate**, the other to an **encoder**.
- Position and tilt detection: Measured using an **Adafruit BNO055 gyroscope** and the encoder.
- Control algorithm: Implemented a **PID controller** on an **Arduino Nano**, tuned to reduce overshoot, improve precision, and minimize oscillations.
- Analysis tools: Used **Arduino IDE Serial Plotter** to observe system response, optimize **Kp, Ki, and Kd** parameters, and evaluate real-time performance.
- The system achieved significantly smoother and more accurate stabilization compared to the ON-OFF controller.

⚠️ **Note**  
None.
